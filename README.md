# PRECISION.array 0.1.0

PRECISION.array is a package which provides a pair of microRNA microarray data sets for the same set of tumor samples, a novel re-sampling algorithm for simulating data under various designs of sample-to-array assignment and levels of signal-to-noise ratios, and a collection of numerical and graphical tools for assessing the performance of data normalization in connection with sample classification based on classification accuracy. In addition to 3 normalization methods and 7 classification methods already imple-mented in the package users can also specify their own method. PRECISION.array enables an objective and systemic evaluation of the interplay between data normalization and sample classification for microRNA microarrays.
