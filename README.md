# PRECISION.array v0.1.0

We propose a new R package PRECISION.array which provides a pipeline for data normalization, resampling based simulations and classification for microRNA microarray data. We provide three normalization methods: median normalization, quantile normalization and variance stabilizing normalization. We provide two virtual re-hybridization methods: confounding design and stratified design. And we provide seven classification methods: PAM, LASSO, ClaNC, kNN, DLDA, SVM.
